					<br><h1><b>	MOLITICS
 
 
 </b>
</h1><br>

 			
 				<p>	August 2016 saw the launch of India’s first ever political awareness app for the public. This was a journey where I made a positive contribution in everyday lives. It also had a leader’s version that helped them to have an updated digital organization.</p>
				</div>
				
			</div>
		
			<div class="center-medium"><br><br>
			<h4 style="margin-left: 10px;"><b>My Role</b></h4>
			<p>I lead the UX work from client interactions to producing all the major deliverables. I was responsible for the experience strategy and design of both the Android apps.</p><br><br>
				
			<h4 style="margin-left: 10px;"><b>The Challenge</b></h4>	
			<p>
				To develop a political brand that helps public and leaders in their political activities. Hence “Molitics” was born. <br> <br>
There were two aspects of the brand. One that catered to the general public and the other that was to be made for the political leaders that would help them with management.
Both were to be presented to the public in form of apps within 4 months (strategy to development). 
			</p><br><br>

				<h3 style="margin-left: 10px;"><b>THE PUBLIC APP: MOLITICS</b></h3>
				<p>Molitics stands for "Media of Politics”. The vision is to become the medium for all political news and raise awareness.

				<h4 style="margin-left: 10px;"><b>The Approach</b></h4>

			<p>Through multiple stakeholder’s meetings, we knew we were not only presenting something new for the masses but also competing with all the major news channels for a space on their phones. We started with developing meaningful goals for the users. <br><br>
For the first phase of the app, we decided to earn trust and customer base by implementing basics brilliantly. Also establish connection through user participation and interaction.
</p><br><br>

				<h4 style="margin-left: 10px;"><b>Discovery</b></h4>
				<p>In this phase I defined the client’s objectives and started with our user research. The research was centred around user needs, behaviours and pain points.I decided to adopt a Lean UX approach due to time and budget constraints.
I created our primary personas, one to four. They were used throughout to guide design decisions, priorities and create empathy. The process has been shown below.</p><br><br>

				<h4 style="margin-left: 10px;"><b>Our Customers</b></h4>
				<p>Two types of primary customers were identified based on localization and their traits were mapped.
With their demographic information, the user research provided menaningful insights.</p><br><br>

With a clarity on the user’s expectations, the universal features anf functionalities are penned down.

Access to regional political news became extremely easy with the use of location. The leaders can be seen according to region and constituency, with an option to follow their political activities.  </p><br><br>

As of now, the app is a work in progress. We are continually conducting usability testing to improve its features and validate our assumptions. </p><br><br>

				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Two months after the public app, this app was launched for politicians in October 2016. This focused on equipping the leaders with modern technology to organise their day-to-day activities.

				<h4 style="margin-left: 10px;"><b>The Approach</b></h4>

			<p style="margin-left: 10px;">After contextual enquiry of daily activities done by the leaders, I had clarity about the important features needed. I also realised that the app is likely to be used by their assistants more than the politicians. This resulted in the creation of two personas and balancing their needs. 
</p><br><br>

				<h4 style="margin-left: 10px;"><b>Discovery</b></h4>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Our stakeholders were influential and visionary politicians. Meetings and interviews with them provided us the canvas for persona creation. </p><br><br>
