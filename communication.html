					<h4> <span></span><b>DOLL MUSEUM</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visual identity redesign <i class="close-ico"></i></h4>
					<div class="content-commu">
						<p>Shankar’s International Dolls Museum has one of the largest collection of costume dolls ranking 10th in

the world. Each doll is handcrafted after meticulous research into the physical attributes, dress and

jewelry of individual characters according to its country and history.

This project was to improve on the visual identity and signage language of the doll museum. Despite

being world renowned, the knowledge about this museum is surprisingly low amongst masses. Even in

the vicinity of the museum, appropriate directional signage is missing to indicate its existence.</p><br><br>
