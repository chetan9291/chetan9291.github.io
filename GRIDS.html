					<br><h1><b>	GRIDS
 
 </b></h1><br>

<p style="margin-left:10px;">Grids have been prevalant in design since the first century BC. Be it the grid based or modular design in architecture, or mandala based planning in Indian Hindu temples. As for ancient art, Greek wall paintings or Indian temple murals are effective examples of implementation of grid with great creativity. <br><br>

The grid in graphic design has evidences from early fifteenth century in Europe. It has evolved through the decades with influences of art movements and prominent graphic designers like Jan Tschichold, Max Bill, Emil Ruder and Josef Muller-Brockmann.</p>

			<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
				The concept of grids in graphic design per say has came into existence with the advent of printing and the industrial revolution. Its study and evolution gives interesting insights and also helps understand their need and usage better. My research on them enhanced my knowledge which I complied as a book, done for one of my college assignments. <br><br>

This book explores the different types and genres of grids like Renaissance and Golden Canon Grid,Industrial Revolution and experimentation with space and design, De Stijl movement, Josef Muller’s Grid System, Karl Gerstner’s exploration, mathematics in grids and much more.

					<p style="margin-left: 20px;">The layout of the entire book embodies the theme of grids in publication design. The layout of every section changes according to different grids used throughout history. To educate on what grid it is, grid outlines printed on butter paper superimposes the content.</p>

					<p style="margin-left: 20px;">The following images are of “Golden Canon Grid” and “Geometric Grid”, one of the few grid types that have been used in the history of publication design. Golden Canon Grids were one of the earliest forms of layout used. Geometric Grid is one of the contemporary grids that explore the relationship of mathematics in grids.</p>

				<h4 style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>Indian Culture and Grids</b></h4>
				<p style="margin-left: 20px;">Grids and design go hand in hand. The application of grids have an underlying philosophy, usage and function. 
</p><br><br><p style="margin-left: 20px;">“The grid system is an aid, not a guarantee. It permits a number of possible uses and each designer can look for a solution appropriate to his personal style.But one must learn how to use the grid; it is an art that requires practice.”-Josef Muller-Brockmann
</p><br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">Indian culture has understood this all- encomapssing feature of grids and exploited it. Examples can be seen in the mandalas, architectural planning of ancient cities, layout of ancient scriptures and Hindu sculptures.

				<p style="margin-left: 20px;">Based on Alice Boner’s geometrical analysis in her book Principles of Composition in Hindu Sculptures, I designed a postcard collection that educates the use of grids in these sculptures.<br><br>

The principal compositional geometry is based on a single circle. The circle is divided into space(horizontal lines) and time divisions(vertical lines) which determine the orientation and movements.</p>

</div>

				<div class="col-xs-12">
					<p style="margin-left: 20px;">The circle is divided by diameters(6-12) into equal sectors. The spacing of the grid lines differs both vertically and horizontally. Boner referred to this as the space division of an image.</p>

				<img src="img/projects/gr/IMG_0785.jpg" class="img-responsive"><br><br><br>
					<p style="margin-left: 20px;">She also suggested that oblique parallel lines, based on one of the either 6, 8, or 12 dividing diameters, also serve as orientation for the sculptures, known as the time division.</p><br><br>

				<p style="margin-left: 20px;">Kimberly Elam is one of the notable, contemporary graphic designers. She has published her original research and understanding of grids in the book “Grid Systems”. On the basis of Elam’s book, I made a 3*3 wooden square that would enable beginners understand the concept and usage of grids.</p>
