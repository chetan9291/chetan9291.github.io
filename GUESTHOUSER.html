					<br><h1><b>	GUESTHOUSER
 </b></h1><br>
 				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">	Indian travel and tourism is growing at an exponential rate. The online travel in India dominates the travel market. Online penetration in travel and tourism bookings has been estimated to increase to 50% by 2020.
Guesthouser has been launched with the vision to help people travel better. With their unique collection of vacation rentals, accommodation is never mundane. It offers the possibility of booking a castle to a treehouse on the same platform.

				<div class="role">	
				<h4 style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>	My Role</b></h4>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">	I joined the organisation as the sole Interaction Designer undertaking the responsibilities of ux and ui design.  All the deliverables related to website and app were ideated, refined and produced backed up by our research.</p>
				</div><br><br>

				<div class="challenge">
					<h4 style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>	The Challenge</b>	</h4>	
					<p style="margin-left: 10px;">	The vision of an unified yet diverse platform for vacation rentals was very new in India. It was directed towards disrupting the dominant hotel stay model in India. The first version of website was up and running for past couple of months. The challenge was to understand the audience we were targeting and provide them with an easy to use and understand interface.</p>

						<h3 style="margin-left: 20px;">	<b>	THE WEBSITE AND APP</b></h3><br>
						<p style="margin-left: 10px;">	The ongoing website was helpful in understanding current patterns and gather user data. Also, it played a vital role in user research.

<br><br><br>

						<h4 style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>	The Approach</b>	</h4>
						<p style="margin-left: 10px;">	I started with interviewing our current customers who had already booked with us. This proved to be insightful and highlighted our areas of focus. 
The new UI overhaul was to build customers organically, have impeccable communication and conversation with them.</p><br>

						<h4 style="margin-left: 20px;">	<b>	Discovery</b></h4>
						<p style="margin-left: 10px;">	The empathic design approach was taken that includes user interviews, survey and contextual inquiry of the target audience.</p>

						<p style="margin-left: 10px;">	With this, the work was furthur prioritised in our limited time. As there was already a working website, the findings were translated into the new design of the new app.
After the phase one the app was designed and successfully launched, the website redesign was given its due importance.</p><br><br><br>

<h4 class="text-center"><b>The Design: Website</b></h4><br><br>

					<img src="img/projects/gh/homepage.jpg" class="img-responsive"><br><br>

					<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Homepage and search pages were identified as the critical pages in need of design. The bounce rate for the homepage was high. One of the reasons identified, was the full page flash banners. This hindered in content visibility and provided no incentive to scroll. Hence, the height was reduced by half. The search bar was made more interactive with the use of two step search, instead of bombarding the user with all the fields at one go. The content was further structured. The USPs of the website was highlighted in crisp and engaging gifs.  This led to the section of recently booked properties, that transparent information and strengthened its authenticity.</p><br><br><br>

				<img src="img/projects/gh/search-page.jpg" class="img-responsive"><br><br>

				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">The challenge was to balance and educate on filters as well as make the search parameters more user friendly. With brainstorming and research insights, the new designs were proposed. Moreover, the critical property details were identified and displayed on the search results page. A/B testing was used as the method to analyze different versions and select the design.</p><br><br><br>

				<img src="img/projects/gh/pp.jpg" class="img-responsive"><br><br>

				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">The rate of bookings done by customer care was extremely high. One of the pain points of users were the lack of desired information in the property preview page. To tackle this problem, content architecture of the page was redefined with a clear visual identity.</p><br><br><br>
				<img src="img/projects/gh/booking-summary.jpg" class="img-responsive"><br><br>


<p style="margin-left: 10px;">The users were unable to keep track of their booking or understand the slightly different process followed by guesthouser. Hence, there were follow up calls to the customer care. So, the booking request summary was made interactive with different steps highlighted and the tentative time that would take in every step.</p><br><br><br>

			<p style="margin-left: 10px;">The app had the same motivation with similar task models tailored for the mobile platform. An informative on-boarding tutorial was designed to explain the concept. On entry, dynamic destination tiles greeted the user, to allow them to discover the app. The search was simple and was highlighted as the actionable button.  The task flows of search and booking process were linear and easy to understand.
