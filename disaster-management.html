 				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">	India is one of the top 10 disaster- prone countries of the world. Every year thousands of lives are lost due to recurring disasters. Acknowledging the problem of lack of awareness; new media and space work together to ensure ease of learning and preparedness.<br><br>

Through the research, the proposed design solution aims to establish a connection between inventiveness and new forms of learning; and establish the its benefit to the augmentation of society.</p>

			<h4 style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>The Disaster Profile</b></h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 10px;">India is vulnerable, in varying degrees, to a large number of disasters. More than 58.6 per cent of the landmass is prone to earthquakes of moderate to very high intensity,over 40 million hectares (12%) of its land is prone to floods and river erosion, close to 5,700 kms, out of the 7,516 kms long coastline is prone to cyclones and tsunamis, 68% of its cultivable area is vulnerable to droughts, and, its hilly areas are at risk from landslides and avalanches.<br><br>

During the last three decades of the 20th century, (1980-2010) natural disasters in India have claimed a total death of 1, 43, 039 people (on an average more than 4,768 death toll every year).</p><br><br>

				<h4 style="font-size:24px;"><b>THE PROPOSED SPACE DESIGN</b></h4>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">The means of disaster awareness in India is limited to classroom textbooks and occassional drills organized by government sectors.
</p><br><br>
				<h4 style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>The Need</b></h4>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">According to research, there is a curriculum in place for disaster management and awareness. Academic innovativeness has been introduced through board and basic online games. Exhibitions and training modules are in place for training adults. <br><br>

There is a lack of this knowledge and consciousness among the general population. The awareness of hazard profile of one’s area or capacity to combat any unpredictable condition is missing. There is no existence of survival kit in the households.  <br><br>

This clearly portrays the failure of current methods employed. The seriousness of mock drills and academic materials is also in question, both from the giving end and the receiving end.  <br><br>

It has become increasingly difficult to capture the attention of the adults and provoke them to be prepared beforehand and not wait till the disaster strikes.</p> <br><br>

				<h4 style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>Approach</b></h4>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">My project is based on a potential of planned innovation through <br>
				(a) dissemination and application of available knowledge, <br>
				(b) adaptation of internationally available quality knowledge to address Indian challenges, and <br>
				(c) creation of new knowledge to address India-specific challenges. <br><br>

				As a holistic approach to learning, a centre has been designed that is engaging as well as educative.The space is divided into different categories catering to different aspects of disaster management that facilitates the hierarchy of information on rapid on-set disasters. </p><br><br>

				<h4 style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>Floor Plan</b></h4>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">The whole area is divided into 7 parts categorized into three prominent types of space, Informative Space, Observation Space and Interactive Space.

					<p>This is the “Reminder phase of awareness”. It has information on common sudden and fast disasters. <br><br>

It has the following<br>
-Infographic timeline of past 25years<br>
-Hazard profile of India<br>
-Role of Disaster Management Authorities<br>
-Recent coverage <br>

				<p>On entrance, the person could see the timelines of different disasters and their effect on the country. That is in form of an infographic mounted on the wall.This timeline is 25’ long and  4’6” wide.<br><br>

 On the wall opposite to it (Wall 2), there is information about various disaster management authorities and the hazard profile of India.</p><br><br><br><br>

 				<h4><b>Observation Space</b></h4>
 				<p>Here the on looker observes crucial information, i.e, the safety measures of different disasters and the effect of a disaster in a confined space. This forms the “Introductory phase” of Awareness.<br><br>

It has <br>
-the safety measures to be taken during different disasters<br>
-effects of disaster in a confined space (earthquake simulation at different richter scales) </p>

The effect on the objects in the platform vary according to the magnitude, portraying it’s intensity to the onlooker.</p><br><br><br>

				<h4 style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>Interactive Space</b></h4>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Surviving a natural disaster has been found to be the third most common type of traumatic experience. <br><br>

It has the following
- Navigating through Debris <br>
- Entering a damaged building after disaster <br>
- Passing through the Floodzone <br>
- Know your fires</p><br><br>

				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">The fourth section gives a comprehensive knowledge on different types of fire and types of fire extinguishers to be used. The person can test his understanding through picking up the corret extinguisher for the fire displayed on the screen. The facade of this area is that of a building.   </p><br><br>
