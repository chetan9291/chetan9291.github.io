					<br><h1><b>	SPEAKING LAW
 
 </b></h1><br>

 			
 				<p style="margin-left: 20px;">	There is an increased dependence of digitalisation and technology in general. An adult needs a lawyer or law advice atleast once a year. The beginning of 2017 will see the launch of “Speaking Law” app that would transform their interaction with law. This will be instrumental in bringing change in people’s lives.<br><br>

This app will help the people find answers to their queries about law from verified lawyers as well as find and book lawyers near them. This app would be personalised further to general public, law students and lawyers.

			<h4 style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>My Role</b></h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 20px;">I lead the UX work producing all the major deliverables and was responsible for its ideation and design. It is designed and developed for the Android platform.</p><br>
				
			<h4 style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>The Challenge</b></h4>	
			<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
				A new concept of development of an unified platform for lawyers and public. There were virtually no competitors a nothing like this had been done before. We had a few law apps that helped lawyers in different ways.
This was a 6 month long project with renowned lawyers being the clients. 
			</p><br>

			<h4 style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>The Approach</b></h4>

			<p style="margin-left: 20px;">The goal was to create a win-win situation for all our segments. Public, Lawyers and Law students. For the launch of the app, we decided to boast the app for its unique concept. The basic functionalities were defined that would educate the users about its usefulness.

				<h4 style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>Discovery</b></h4>
				<p style="margin-left: 20px;">I conducted interviews with our stakeholders, the adults(20+), the law students and the lawyers to understand their needs and pain points prevalant in the present scenario.  Following this, personas and user stories were created. I drew inferences about the giving the users beneficial features and add value to their lives.</p><br><br>

				<h4 style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>Persona</b></h4>
				<p style="margin-left: 20px;">It was instrumental in deciding functionality, uncovering gaps, and highlighting new opportunities. The following process depicted is with the public in focus.   </p><br><br>

				<h4 style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>The Framework</b></h4>
				<p style="margin-left: 20px;">According to the user segments, I structured the app to be unified and serve them individually. Everyone was treated as public and shown the generic content, till they chose another segment and their role was verified.
